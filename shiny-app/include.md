### Welcome to storm database explorer

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

The data contains different types of natural disaster events and its economic and population effects. This application focuses only on population effect that includes fatalities and injuries count.
User can adjust date range and event types using control panel located on the left side. Based on the selection, the application aggregates the fatalities and injuries count and present the aggregated counts in selected year range and categories of events.

Users can control following parameters to view the chart representation of the data:
* Year range -  using the slider on top left
* Event types - using the checkboxes on the left panel
* Impact(Fatalities and Casualties) - using radio button within the chart (top right)
